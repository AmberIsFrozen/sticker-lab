# Sticker sources
The original source file of images drawn with Inkscape is saved here.  
These files are stored in the Inkscape SVG format and may opened with [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/).

Note that not all drawn images have their sources as some that are drawn early on does not have a backup/are saved in varying formats.
